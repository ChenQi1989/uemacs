TODO List
---------

Boundary:
* portability
* small size

Goal:
* learn from the current codes
* provide a way for emacs compatibility
* support cross compilation

0. Read the codes and understand the design

1. Restore traditional emacs key cuts

2. Support Ctrl-Z to put uemacs to background

   terminal attributes?

3. [RESOLVED] XON/XOFF flow control is deliberately enabled, should we disable it?

   My answer is YES. Do it. And test it on linux and mac where XON/XOFF flow
   control is usually turned on by default.

4. [RESOLVED] Ctrl + S (forwsearch) does not work on Mac

   This is because Mac by default set 'ixon -ixoff', so Ctrl-S does not stop
   the termimal but also is captured by the device driver. `stty -ixon' will
   make things work.

5. [RESOLVED] Even if XONXOFF macro is defined to 1, Ctrl-S still has no effect in em.

   As '-DPOSIX' is supplied when building for Darwin, Linux and FreeBSD, it is
   ttopen function in posix.c file that has effect. But it does not check XONXOFF
   macro.

   To fix this problem, modify the ttopen function in posix.c to also consider
   XONXOFF.

6. Chinese input has some problem about the cursor location.
